### Roc Examples - migrate to "Headerless" Applications

**Summary**

Based on the provided transcript, here is the summary: Hannes expresses concern that new users searching for basic tasks, such as reading a file, will immediately discover they need to use "other platforms" rather than finding a solution within Roc.

**Key points**

- Hannes predicts a user's first interaction will be a Google search for common operations like "how to read file in Roc".
- The search results would likely lead users to realize they must rely on external platforms.

**Open questions**

- None identified.

**Action items**

- None identified.
